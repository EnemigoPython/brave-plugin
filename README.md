# Brave Plugin

This is an Obsidian plugin created using the [sample plugin template](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin).

I created this plugin to:

- Archive completed tasks automatically
- Track recurring tasks with an associated time field (not implemented yet)

This is currently just a personal project for my own needs so it isn't released to the plugin library.
